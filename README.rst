A tutorial about creating highly scalable webbackends for iOS developers.

This repository contains the sources for a tiny blog application with an ios
frontend and a web backend built with:

   - `Lovely Pyrest <http://lovelysystems.github.io/lovely.pyrest/index.html>`_ A Web-Framework on top of `pyramid <http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about>`_
   - `Crate <https://crate.io>`_ An SQL and Doc-oriented databse

In this
`tutorial <http://lovelysystems.github.io/lovely.microblog/>`_, we will walk
through the creation of the frontend and backend.
